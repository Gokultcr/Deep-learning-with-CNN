# Deep-learning-with-CNN

Here deep learning algorithm is applied on CIFAR10 dataset for image classification. CNN parameters are tunned with different values for finding the best parameter values. 

# CIFAR10 Dataset
Dataset consists of 60000 colour (r * g * b) images of size 32x32 with 10 classes.
* Airplane
* Automobile
* Bird
* Cat
* Deer
* Dog 
* Frog
* Horse
* Ship
* Truck

# Libraries
* Tensorflow
* Matplotlib
* Numpy

# Activation functions
* relu
* softmax
* sigmoid

# Optimizer
* adam
* nadam

# Summary
Here the CNN alogorithm evaluated with different filter values, activation functions and optimizers. The intial CNN with specified parametres are effective compared to other codes executed over here.
